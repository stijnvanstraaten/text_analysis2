Exercise 1:
1a:
There are 5 nouns that refer to a relative, they are:
['child', 'wife', 'wife', 'mother', 'father']

1b:
There are 1 nouns that refer to a illness, they are:
['disease']

1c:
There are 2 nouns that refer to a science, they are:
['science', 'science']

2:
There were 10 cases of a noun only having one hypernym, for example:
[['wedlock', {Synset('state.n.02')}], ['month', {Synset('measure.n.02')}], ['disease', {Synset('state.n.02')}]]

There were 38 cases where we had to choose between multiple hypernyms. Our system did not make any choice, we just followed all paths to the top hypernyms.
To make a decision you have to look at the context and make a decision for yourself, here are two examples:
[['mathematician', {Synset('object.n.01'), Synset('person.n.01')}], ['writer', {Synset('object.n.01'), Synset('person.n.01')}]]

The average length of hypernyms per noun is: 2.75

Exercise 2:
1:
3-classes:
The text contains 29 people, namely: ['Lovelace', 'Augusta', 'Ada', 'Byron', 'Ada', 'Lovelace', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Lovelace', 'Byron', 'Anne', 'Isabella', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Byron', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Babbage', 'Luigi', 'Menabrea', 'Lovelace', 'Babbage', 'Ada']
The text contains 4 organizations, namely: ['Augusta', 'Ada', 'King', 'Ada']
The text contains 1 locations, namely: ['England']

Only the organizations are not correct, names are being seen as organizations

2:
4-classes:
The text contains 19 people, namely: ['Lovelace', 'Ada', 'Lovelace', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Lovelace', 'Byron', 'Anne', 'Isabella', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Babbage', 'Luigi', 'Menabrea', 'Lovelace', 'Babbage']
The text contains 21 organizations, namely: ['Augusta', 'Ada', 'King', 'Augusta', 'Ada', 'Byron', 'Analytical', 'Engine', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', '&', 'Metaphysician', 'Analytical', 'Engine', 'Ada', 'Analytical', 'Engine']
The text contains 3 locations, namely: ['England', 'Lord', 'Byron']
The text contains 8 miscs, namely: ['English', 'mathematician', 'Greek', 'War', 'of', 'Independence', 'British', 'Italian']

The 4-classes model also has the miscs tag, in this case they are mostly adjectives. It also identifies way more organizations which are still mostly names. For some reason it also sees "Lord" and "Byron" as locations.

7-classes:
The text contains 22 people, namely: ['Ada', 'King', 'Lovelace', 'Ada', 'Lovelace', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Lovelace', 'Lord', 'Byron', 'Anne', 'Isabella', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Byron', 'Charles', 'Babbage', 'Babbage', 'Luigi', 'Menabrea', 'Lovelace']
The text contains 14 organizations, namely: ['Augusta', 'Ada', 'Byron', 'Analytical', 'Engine', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Ada', 'Analytical', 'Engine', 'Ada']
The text contains 1 locations, namely: ['England']
The text contains 9 dates, namely: ['December', '1815', '27', 'November', '1852', 'December', '1815', '1842', '1843']
The text contains 0 words with the money tag.
The text contains 0 words with the percent tag.
The text contains 0 words with the time tag.

The 7-classes model also has the dates, money, percent and time tag instead of miscs. It did not find any money, percent and time words. It did however find 9 dates which are all correct.

3:
We chose the 3-classes model because it is harder to make mistakes. There is a big difference between every word, words can mean different things and because of that also fit in multiple classes. Most nouns are already locations, persons or organizations this fits with the 3-classes model.

These are all the nouns in the text:
{'poet', 'death', 'month', 'computer', 'vision', 'Babbage', 'history', 'world', 'wife', 'mind-set', 'science', 'technology', 'article', 'effort', 'programâ€”that', 'wedlock', 'engine', 'relationship', 'friendship',
'capability', 'approach', 'relate', 'logic', 'set', 'insanity', 'machine', 'disease', 'adult', 'tool', 'request', 'chiefly', 'algorithm', 'father', 'interest', 'child', 'society', 'writer', 'mathematician', 'working',
'programmer', 'mother', 'engineer', 'work'}
